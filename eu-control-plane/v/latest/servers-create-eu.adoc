= To Create a Server (EU Control Plane)

[NOTE]
From the EU control plane, you can only create servers using Mule Runtime Agent version 1.9.2 and later. Ensure that you have installed this version in your Mule runtime environment.

To manage a remote server from the EU control plane you must run the `amc_setup` script to create a server by configuring the Runtime Manager Agent to communicate with Runtime Manager. 

The procedures for creating a server are similar to those for creating a server in the US control plane. The difference is that you must use the `--region eu1` option when running `amc_setup` as shown in the following example:

----
./amc_setup --region eu1 -H 1234321xyzabc----16 your-eu-server-name
----

This flag ensures that the server connects to Runtime Manager in the EU control plane. When you click Add Server in the  Runtime Manager > Servers tab, Runtime Manager in the EU control plane automatically inserts this flag in the generated script.

== Ports IPs and hostnames to Whitelist

In your network, you may need to whitelist the hostnames and ports of various parts of the Anypoint Platform to allow the Runtime Manager Agent in a customer-hosted Mule runtime to communicate with the MuleSoft-managed online Anypoint Platform APIs and services.

These tables show you the ports or IPs/hostnames to add to your whitelists to allow communication between the Runtime Manager Agent and the Runtime Manager console:

*Ports*

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Name |Port
|*eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* | 443
|*mule-manager.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* | 443
|*analytics-ingest.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* |  443
|*arm-auth-proxy.prod-eu.msap.io* |  443
|===

*Static IPs*

There are two Static IPs that needs to be whitelisted to access the mule-manager.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com hostname.

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Name |IP Address
|*mule-manager.anypoint.eu1.mulesoft.com* |18.194.245.32
|*mule-manager.anypoint.eu1.mulesoft.com* |18.195.19.18
|===

*Dynamic IPs*

Some of the IP addresses used by Anypoint services are assigned automatically by the underlying cloud infrastructure, and hence we can't guarantee that they are not going to change in the future.

For this reason, you should not implement a whitelist based on the specific IP addresses being assigned to Anypoint services.

Nowadays, many firewall devices allow you to define Layer 7 Firewall Rules, where you could be able to filter by destination name or application type.

The hostnames that you should include in your Layer 7 Firewall rules include:

[%header,cols="1*a"]
|===
|Hostname
|*eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com*
|*analytics-ingest.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com*
|*arm-auth-proxy.prod-eu.msap.io*
|===
