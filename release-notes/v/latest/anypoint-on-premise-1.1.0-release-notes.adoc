== Release Cadence

We expect to ship a new version of the Anypoint Platform with new features around 6 months from now.

Given that the Anypoint Platform for On Premises is a snapshot of our Cloud solution, it will most likely not contain all the latest features developed for the cloud until a new version comes out with those. We cannot guarantee that all the Cloud Platform functionality will be available for On Premises, so we will highlight those differences as we have them.

== Current differences with the Cloud Version

There are some differences between the current On premises release and the Cloud version of the Anypoint Platform, these are detailed below:

*CloudHub/Applications*:
In the On Premises release, the CloudHub name has been changed to *Applications* as that is where you will be managing your applications and servers through the Anypoint Runtime Manager.

*Anypoint Exchange*:
This is a private version of Anypoint Exchange, so you will not be able to see the public content available in the Cloud Version.

*Anypoint Platform for APIs*
The On Premises version does not contain API Analytics. 

*Anypoint Runtime Manager*
The On Premises version does not contain Audit login functionality. 

== Known issues

AGW-695 Currently the API Gateway 2.1.0 or earlier running on Java 7 will default to TLS 1.0 that will cause a problem to use it with the AnyPoint platform on premises. This issue will not be there if you run it on Java 8, or apply the patch created for this problem.
