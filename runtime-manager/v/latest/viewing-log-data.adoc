CloudHub provides access to log data so that you can monitor your application and diagnose any potential issues. CloudHub stores log data in Universal Time (UTC); however, the console displays the log using your computer's local time zone. 

[NOTE]
====
Logs and diagnostics are a feature that is currently only available for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. They are not available for applications that you deploy via the Runtime Manager to local servers, in those cases you can send data link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[to External Monitoring Software]. See link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[Deployment Strategies] and link:/runtime-manager/monitoring[Monitoring Applications] for more details.

Applications deployed to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) don't expose any log data through Runtime Manager, but you can see event logs on Pivotal's UI.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you delete an application, your log data is no longer accessible through the console. CloudHub archives old log data for a limited period of time before being purged. This allows you to recover the data if needed. mailto:cloudhub-support@mulesoft.com[Contact Support] for more information.
====


== Enhanced Log Management

CloudHub provides an optional user interface and expanded storage capabilities for logging and diagnostics with the new Enhanced Log Management setting. Logs can be up to 100 MB or up to 30 days, whichever limit is hit first.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Important:*

* Before using enhanced logging, download all existing logs. When you enable this feature, the verify prompt contains a link to download your logs to your computer. The logs are saved as a text file.
* When you enable enhanced logging, CloudHub restarts your application, with link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications#zero-downtime-updates-with-cloudhub[*zero downtime*].
* For new apps, enhanced log management is enabled by default. For existing apps, you must opt in to enable enhanced logging.
* App Diagnostics are only available for applications that run on Mule runtime versions either 3.8.1 or above or link:/release-notes/mule-esb-3.7.4-release-notes[3.7.4] or above
====

To enable this feature:

. Sign in to the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] and click *Runtime Manager*.
. Click an application to expand the details view:
+
image:CHApps.png[CHApps]
+
. Click *Settings* > *Enhanced Log Management*. 
+
image:EnLogMgmt.png[EnLogMgmt]
+
The verification prompt appears:
+
image:ELMEnableChangeSettingsPrompt.png[ELMEnableChangeSettingsPrompt]
+
. Click *Download logs*. Your computer opens a Save File dialog box where you can locate the directory to save the log file in. The log is saved as a text file with the .log file type. 
. After you save your files, click the *I understand log history will be lost* ... prompt, and click *Change Settings*. 
. In the bottom of the CloudHub Settings screen, click *Apply Changes*.
. Click *Logs*. The new Enhanced Log Management screen appears. The application restarts after setting enhanced logging. The logs list deployment messages and events for each worker. You can use Advanced search to list errors or different message priorities--see <<Search by Message Priority, search by message priority>>.
+
image:ELMStart.png[ELMStart]
+
. The Filters section on the right of the enhanced logging screen lets you selectively view the output by day, Deployment, System Log, and Workers. You can unapply a filter by unticking the checkbox next to a date.
+
image:ELMfilters.png[ELMfilters]
+
. The Filters section also contains the download buttons for both Logs and Diagnostics, to download the logs and diagnostics of the current worker and deployment:
+
image:DownloadLogs.png[DownloadLogs]
+
. You can also search for log content, or click *Advanced* to search for a time or day, or date range, or by message priority. After you choose, click *Apply*. For more information, see <<Advanced Search, Advanced Search>>.

*Note*: Enhanced logging combines both live and archive views into a single UI, so there is no longer a way to pause or clear the live view window.

=== Downloading Logs in Enhanced Logging

For the best audit trail, you may wish to download logs from enhanced logging. In enhanced logging, there are logs for each worker in each deployment.
In the following example, there are 3 logs you may wish to back up:

image:ELMmanyLogs.png[ELMmanyLogs]

When you hover over the download symbol, a panel will open to display both logs and diagnostics, click on the download symbol that corresponds to logs. Your computer then displays a dialog box to let you save the log file. The log file is a text file with the .log file type. You can view this file with a text editor.

[NOTE]
In case your app runs in a Mule version prior to 3.8.0 (excluding version 3.7.4), you will only have the option to download the logs, as diagnostics aren't available for those versions.

The log file is named in the format of: _deployment-ID_`.`_instance-ID_`.log`

=== Downloading Diagnostics in Enhanced Logging

[NOTE]
This feature is only available for applications that run on Mule versions 3.8.1 and later (as well as version 3.7.4).

Diagnostics display the Java thread dump of the CloudHub worker, indicating the current state of the server, useful for debugging and support.

Diagnostics must also be downloaded from the enhanced logging page. In enhanced logging, there are diagnostics for each worker in each deployment:

image:ELMmanyDiagnostics.png[ELMmanyLogs]

When you hover over the download symbol, a panel will open to display both logs and diagnostics, click on the download symbol that corresponds to diagnostics. Your computer then displays a dialog box to let you save the log file. The log file is a text file with the .txt file type. You can view this file with a text editor.


[TIP]
====
On the diagnostics, the instance ID of a worker is set as deployment id + worker number (0 to 4)

You can also download a diagnostics file directly, without having to go through the UI, by accessing the following URL:

`api/v2/applications/appName/instances/instanceId/diagnostics`
====


=== Disabling Enhanced Logging

*Important*: Before disabling enhanced logging, back up each worker's logs from each deployment. Disabling enhanced logging deletes all logs and restarts your application.

To disable enhanced logging:

. Click *Settings* and uncheck *Enhanced Log Management*.
. In the following prompt, click the *I understand* ... message and click *Change Settings:

== Default Log Management

If *Enhanced Log Management* is not selected, CloudHub saves 100,000 log events per application. Logs that exceed the limit are truncated every 24 hours to 100,000 events by discarding the oldest events past the limit. Individual log entries are limited to a maximum length of 100K characters; longer log entries are truncated to the limit.

The default interface differs from that of enhanced logging:

image:chlog.png[chlog]

=== Pausing and Clearing a Log

To pause the log so that entries are temporarily stopped from writing, click *Live view* and click *Pause*. While the log is paused, a green *Resume* button appears. Click *Resume* to enable more content to be written.

image:ResumeLog.png[ResumeLog]

In *Live view*, you can click the *Clear* button to clear the viewing window, so you only see the latest logs generated by the application, which is useful for debugging. The log contents are not deleted, so if you switch views to Archive and back to Live view, the full contents of the log reappear. You can also refresh your browser to see the full log.

image:LogClear.png[LogClear]

=== Log Page Controls

CloudHub provides page controls to help you move through the logs when you view historical data. The most recent logs are on page one. The data gets older as you step through the higher pages. 

You can configure the number of results that display on each page by clicking *Archive* and the down-arrow next to the number of entries:

image:LogsPages.png[LogsPages]

Click *FIRST*, *LAST*, or the number of entries to view per page, *10*, *25*, or *50*.
=== Downloading Log Data

Click *Archive* and click *Download* to save a copy of the current log view to your computer:

image:LogsDownload.png[LogsDownload]

You are prompted for a save location. You can download a maximum of 10,000 lines of log data with a single save. However, using repeated views with contiguous time windows as search criteria, the entire log may be downloaded.

=== Advanced Search

Advanced search lets you search logs by date and priority. The Advanced search interface is the same for enhanced logging and default logging.

*Enhanced logging* - Click *Advanced* in the search field. Enhanced only provides a live console.

*Default logging* - Click *Live view* to provide a live, continually updated stream of current log data from all an application's workers. Click  *Advanced*  in the search field to search only for strings in the logs. Click *Archive view* and *Advanced* to set search by text, date, or priority.

The Advanced search interface is as follows (shown for enhanced logging):

image:ELMAdvSearch.png[ELMAdvSearch]

=== Search by Date and Time

The *Date & Time* filter lets you specify a date range to search the log. Possible values are:

* Last hour
* Last 24hrs
* Last week
* Last month

=== Search by Message Priority

The Priority filter lets you view specific events in the log. You can also specify different priorities by typing `priority<type>` in the search box, as shown in the Command column in the table.

Possible values are:

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
| Value
| Description
| Command

| All Priorities
| List all messages
| N/A

| ERROR
| List only error messages, such when an exception occurs.
| priority:ERROR

| FATAL
| List only fatal messages for when an application fails
| priority:FATAL

| INFO
| List informative messages

| DEBUG
| List debugging messages
| priority:DEBUG

|===

=== Wildcard Searching

You can also filter log data by entering search terms into the search box at the top of the log page that match results in the log message. You can search for any exact term in the log message as well as a few common quantifiers for wildcard searching:

* `?` - The question mark matches zero or one of the preceding element.
* `*` - The asterisk matches zero or more of the preceding element.
