== Overview

Runtime Manager is the enterprise link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-platform-primer[Anypoint Platform] tool used to deploy and manage all of your link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/begin-with-the-basics[Mule applications] in one central location, whether your apps are running in the cloud or on-premises.

After you have created a Mule application (for example, see link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/build-a-hello-world-application[Hello World Mule application]), you can deploy it through Runtime Manager. Runtime Manager is designed specifically for handling Mule applications, and deploying them to Mule runtime instances which can reside on:

* An on-premise *server*, or several of them grouped as a *server group* or *cluster*
* A CloudHub virtual worker

[TIP]
link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] is a complete Platform as a Service that covers all of your server needs out of the box, including Object Store infrastructure, Monitoring, Troubleshooting, Scheduling, etc.



Runtime Manager provides a dashboard that indicates the status of every deployed app and monitored server, with a rich set of features you can use to manage and track activity of your running applications.

[INFO]
For managing apps on your own servers, you can still resort to the link:/mule-management-console/v/3.8/index[Mule Management Console] as an alternative to the Runtime Manager. This tool is no longer being developed, but has some features that are currently not yet implemented in the Runtime Manager for on-premise deployment scenarios.
