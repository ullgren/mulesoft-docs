== Running Studio on a Mac

If you're using Mac OS, there are two extra considerations when running Anypoint Studio.

*Java Runtime Environment*

Check to confirm that the Java runtime environment 7 or 8 is in place on your system. From the command line (Terminal app), run: `java -version`

The JDK 7 response should appear similar to:

[source, code, linenums]
----
java version "1.7.0_55"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_55-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.55-b03, mixed mode)
----

The JDK 8 response is similar to:

[source, code, linenums]
----
java version "1.8.0_51"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_51-b16)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.51-b03, mixed mode)
----

If a Java runtime environment is _not_ installed, the command triggers a prompt to install the JDK tools directly from Apple. Follow the instructions to download and install JDK 7 or 8.

*Application Execution*

By default, Mac OS X restricts execution of applications acquired outside the Apple App Store. Because you download Anypoint Studio _outside_ the App Store, your system may prevent you from running Studio applications and issue a warning message advising you to change your security settings to proceed. +
(Note: you must have Administrator privileges to adjust the security settings.)

. On your Mac, open *System Preferences*, then navigate to *Security & Privacy*.

. In the *General* tab, under "Allow applications downloaded from:", select the radio button for *Anywhere*.

[NOTE]
--
Depending on your security configuration, OSx might throw an error message with the description: *Application is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the trash*. +
Apple's Gatekeeper displays this message because the application bundle is not digitally signed. It's recommended for you to follow the steps described above to disable Gatekeeper and run Studio for the first time. +
You can enable Gatekeeper again after the first successful launch of Studio.
--

== Downloading Enterprise Additions

If you are running *Anypoint Studio* with an *Enterprise runtime*, you can add additional modules to your Studio instance.

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/installing-anypoint-enterprise-security[Anypoint Enterprise Security]
